# cnn-cifar10-fashion
This project contains custom a custom made CNN AI model for the MNIST Fashion Dataset as well as the Cifar10 Dataset

It is a beginners project to Deep Learning amd relies of using Tensorflow to create these models. 

Within this repository, it contains 2 pb model files  of the CNN for Cifar10 and CNN for Fashion MNIST, there are also powerpoint slides describing the different steps taken in improving the models incrementally. 
There are also the original Jupyter sourcse files used to create these models
